            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                White Water Rafting was founded in 1998 by a group of lifelong river guides who
                shared a passion for adventure and a deep respect for the outdoors. What began as
                a small, locally run operation with a single raft has grown into a trusted rafting
                company known for professionalism, safety, and unforgettable experiences.

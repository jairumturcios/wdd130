            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White Water Rafting was founded in 1998 by a group of lifelong river guides who
                shared a passion for
                adventure and a deep respect for the outdoors. What began as a small, locally run
                operation with a
                single raft has grown into a trusted rafting company known for professionalism,
                safety, and
                unforgettable experiences. Over the years, RiverRush has guided thousands of guests
                down some of the
                region’s most iconic rivers while remaining committed to preserving the natural
                environments that
                make each journey possible.</p>
